Fixed @selfboot on UZO.  Was problem because new queue terminates all commands caused by a player if they log off. Ooops.
check_lockout now checks the first character in a line, and if it's # it ignores the line.  Much better than trying to resolve hosts with a # at the front. :)
getpeername() is only called once now, and info is passed get_ident rather than calling it twice.
