    get(<object>/<attr>)                  - Retrieve value in code

EXECUTABLE ATTRIBUTES:

Attributes can contain code with functions and substitutions. Code executes
when the attribute is triggered (manually or by events).

Substitutions:
    %#                - Triggering player (enactor)
    %!                - Object owning the attribute
    %0-%9             - Passed arguments
    %N                - Enactor name
    %L                - Enactor location
    ##                - Current list element (in @foreach)

    *PlayerName       - Specific player by name
    me                - Lock owner
    $<object>         - Indirect (use object's lock key)

Attribute Checks:
    <attr>:<value>    - Attribute equals value
    <attr>:           - Attribute exists with any value

Operators:
    !<key>            - NOT (invert condition)
    <key>|<key>       - OR (either condition)

& zones
ZONE SYSTEM

Zones organize related objects into groups for centralized control and
theming. Objects can belong to multiple zones through parent chains.

BASIC ZONE OPERATIONS:

Linking to Zones:
    @zlink <object>=<zone object>         - Add object to zone
    @unzlink <object>                     - Remove from zone

Creating Zones:
Zones are typically special objects (things or rooms) designated for
organizational purposes. Create a regular object and use it as a zone.

ZONE FUNCTIONS:

Query Functions:
    zone(<object>)                        - Get primary zone of object
    lzone(<zone>)                         - List all objects in zone
    inzone(<object>,<zone>)               - Test zone membership

Zone Commands:
    @gzone <zone>=<command>               - Execute command for zone
    @zemit <zone>=<message>               - Emit message to zone

USES FOR ZONES:

Organization:
    - Group themed areas (e.g., "Fantasy District", "SciFi Sector")
    - Collect related objects for management
    - Apply zone-wide settings or themes

Administration:
    - Track ownership and attribution
    - Apply consistent settings
    - Enable zone-wide announcements

Broadcasting:
    - Send messages to all zone members
    - Coordinate area-wide events

Example Zone Setup:
    @create Zone Controller
    @set Zone Controller=ZONE
    @zlink room1=Zone Controller
    @zlink room2=Zone Controller
    @zlink room3=Zone Controller

PROGRAMMING IN deMUSE

deMUSE includes a powerful embedded programming language for creating
interactive objects and automated behaviors.

CORE CONCEPTS:

1. ATTRIBUTES - Storage and code containers
2. FUNCTIONS - Built-in operations
3. SUBSTITUTIONS - Dynamic value replacement
4. TRIGGERS - Code execution events

BASIC SUBSTITUTIONS:

Player/Object References:
    %#                - Player triggering the action (enactor)
    %!                - Object containing the attribute
    %L                - Location of enactor
    %N                - Name of enactor

Pronouns:
    %S                - Subjective pronoun (he/she/it/they)
    %O                - Objective pronoun (him/her/it/them)
    %P                - Possessive pronoun (his/her/its/their)
    %A                - Absolute possessive (his/hers/its/theirs)

Arguments:
    %0                - First argument (0-9 available)
    %1, %2, etc.      - Additional arguments

Special:
    ##                - Current element in @foreach loop
    \\n               - Newline
    \\t               - Tab
    %r                - Carriage return
    %b                - Blank space

FUNCTION SYNTAX:

Call functions using square brackets:
    [function_name(arg1,arg2,...)]

Nested calls:
    [add([get(me/COUNT)],1)]

EXAMPLES:

Simple substitution:
    @set welcome=DESC:Welcome, %N!

Function usage:
    @set sign=DESC:This room has [add(5,3)] exits.

Combining both:
    @set greeter=DESC:Hello %N! You are in [name(loc(%#))].

Executable attribute:
    @set counter=USE:@set me=COUNT:[add(get(me/COUNT),1)];\
                      @pemit %#=Count is now [get(me/COUNT)]

CONTROL STRUCTURES:

Conditionals:
    [ifelse(<condition>,<true action>,<false action>)]
    @switch <expr>=<case1>,<action1>,<case2>,<action2>,...

Iteration:
    @foreach <list>=<command with ##>
    [foreach(<list>,<attr>)]

BEST PRACTICES:

1. Test code incrementally
2. Use examine to debug attributes
3. Check for infinite loops
4. Validate inputs in public-facing code
5. Document complex logic with comments in DESC

& triggers
TRIGGER COMMANDS

Triggers execute attribute code on demand or in response to events.

MANUAL TRIGGERS:

@TRIGGER <object>/<attribute>[=<arguments>]
    Executes the specified attribute on the object. Arguments are passed
    as %0-%9 to the code.

    Permissions: Must control the object

    Examples:
        @trigger me/GREET
        @trigger here/ANNOUNCE=The meeting will start soon!

@TR_AS <executor>=<object>/<attribute>[=<arguments>]
    Triggers an attribute as if <executor> had triggered it. The executor's
    permissions and identity (%#) are used.

    Permissions: Must control both executor and target object

    Example:
        @tr_as *Bob=here/WELCOME

AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS:

Connection Events:
    ACONNECT          - Player connects to game
    ADISCONNECT       - Player disconnects from game

Interaction Events:
    ADESC             - Someone examines/looks at object
    AUSE              - Someone uses object (@use command)
    AHEAR             - Someone speaks near object
    AMHEAR            - Speech matches LISTEN pattern

Action Events:
    ASUCC             - Action succeeds (moving through exit)
    AFAIL             - Action fails (locked exit)
    ADROP             - Object is dropped
    ALEAVE            - Someone leaves object
    AENTER            - Someone enters object

TRIGGER CONTEXT:

When an attribute triggers:
    %#                - Player who triggered it
    %!                - Object with the attribute
    %0-%9             - Arguments (manual triggers)
    %N                - Triggering player's name
    %L                - Triggering player's location

ADVANCED USAGE:

Chaining Triggers:
    @set obj1=TRIGGER2:@trigger obj2/RESPONSE=%0
    @trigger obj1/TRIGGER2=Hello

Passing Data:
    @set calculator=COMPUTE:@pemit %#=Result: [add(%0,%1)]
    @trigger calculator/COMPUTE=5 3

& control
CONTROL FLOW COMMANDS

Commands for conditional execution, iteration, and program flow control.

@SWITCH <expression>=<pattern1>,<action1>,<pattern2>,<action2>,...

    Evaluates expression and executes action for first matching pattern.
    Use * as catch-all default case.

    Examples:
        @switch [get(me/STATUS)]=active,smile,inactive,frown,*,shrug
        @switch %0=north,@tel %#=#123,south,@tel %#=#124

@FOREACH <list>=<command>

    Executes command for each element in space-separated list.
    Use ## as placeholder for current element.

    Examples:
        @foreach [lwho()]=@pemit ##=Server restarting in 5 minutes!
        @foreach [lcon(here)]=@tel ##=home

@CYCLE <object>/<attr1> <attr2> <attr3> ...

    Rotates values through a list of attributes. Value from attr1 moves
    to attr2, attr2 to attr3, etc., and last wraps to first.

    Example:
        @set sign=MSG1:North
        @set sign=MSG2:East
        @set sign=MSG3:South
        @set sign=MSG4:West
        @cycle sign/MSG1 MSG2 MSG3 MSG4

@WAIT <seconds>=<command>

    Delays execution of command. Queues command to execute after delay.
    Maximum delay depends on server configuration.

    Examples:
        @wait 5=@emit Time's up!
        @wait 10=@tel %#=home

@AS <object>=<command>

    Executes command as if <object> typed it. Uses object's permissions
    and identity.

    Permissions: Must control <object>

    Example:
        @as *Bob=say Hello everyone!

@AT <location>=<command>

    Executes command as if run from <location>. Useful for remote actions.

    Example:
        @at #123=@emit [name(%#)] performs a remote action.

@PBREAK

    Breaks out of current @foreach loop. Useful for conditional termination.

    Example:
        @foreach [lcon(here)]=@switch [name(##)]=Target,@pbreak

@EXEC <code>

    Directly executes code/expression and displays result. Useful for
    testing functions and debugging.

    Example:
        @exec add(5,3)
        @exec get(me/COUNT)
