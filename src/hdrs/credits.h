   The following definitions are used to implement an automatic version
   number calculation system.  While major code changes reflect version
   number changes in the BASE_VERSION number variable (see below), day to
   day hacks require too much upkeep of the version number.  To simplify
   matters, dates of code changes are used to calculate a 4 field version
   number of the form: 'vX.X.X.X'.
