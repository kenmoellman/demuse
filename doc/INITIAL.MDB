The initial test database
-------------------------

The initial test database (run/db/test.mdb) comes with two characters.
One wizard, 'Wizard', and one GOD character that shouldn't normally be
used, 'root'. Both have password 'mike'.

This database contains a few rooms, but nothing much. It is mostly
used for testing out things. If you want to start completely over,
just @destroy everything.  A minimal database may be provided in a
future release.
