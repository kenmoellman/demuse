This is deMUSE 2k, a TinyMUSE variant.  TinyMUSE currently belongs
to shkoo, and per shkoo, there is no restriction on using the name
"MUSE" in conjunction witha software release. The only restriction
is on the name "TinyMUSE".

This is not TinyMUSE. deMUSE is a branch from an official TinyMUSE
distribution (TinyMUSE '97) on which the main developer previously 
had worked.

Please email dm2k@mu-net.org for assistance, bug reports, etc etc.
