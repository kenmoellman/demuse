Starting your muse
------------------

go into the run directory, and type '../bin/wd'
and things will restart. if you want to give
arguments to wd, they should be as follows:

wd <database load file> <database save file> <general log file> <port number>.

by default, this should probably be

wd db/mdb db/mdb logs/out.log 4201
or, if you're using DBCOMP,
wd db/mdb.Z db/mdb.Z logs/out.log 4201

-shkoo


I would recommend you compile in the changes for mdb and port, etc, if you're
going to change them.  I've seen problems (user errors) that are caused by 
not doing so.  Shop smart, shop S-Mart!    -wm
