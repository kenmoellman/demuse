Installation instructions
-------------------------

1) the ./domakefile script is broken.  it hasn't worked in years.
   I don't know enough about make to make it function properly.
   I edit the Makefiles. Dangerous? yes.  But keep a backup copy
   and it's no big deal.  if you need help, ask a Unix/C 
   programmer or email me.

2) if you're familiar with MUSE and C programming, you may wish
   to edit config/config.[ch] and change some options around.

3) go to the src directory, and do a 'make install'

4) go into run/msgs and edit the files as you please.  This can 
   wait until last, but, i would recommend that you edit the files
   before you make your MUSE publicly known as "online".  The
   special files, helpindx and newsindx are created by first 
   editting helptext and newstext, and then executing: 
   ../../bin/mkindx news ; ../../bin/mkindx help

5) Unless you are upgrading from a previous version of demuse,
   tinymuse 97, or tinymuse 1.8a4 or earlier, you will need to
   go to the run/db directory and copy initial.mdb to mdb

6) You're now ready to go on.
