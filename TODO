This is my TODO list as of now.  It's just fun to see where people are going
with things, IMO, so here's some stuff i'm planning on doing as of today
(12/31/2000)

test @passwording root with a blanked out PW
check for bug in examine... broke at look.c line 581.. had bad information. looks like an overrun.
 -- replace the global matching functions with onesthat return variables instead.
puppet objects don't send colored text, send color codes instead.
who list on login screen sends ansi codes rather than stripping out color.
@mode lets you set yourself IRC/MUSE/MUSH/whatever and uses the parituclar parser you specify.
  -- rebuild parser to include functionality from many games.

----------
Replace command and function parsers with new hash tables.
  -  bug in @prefix/@suffix - if have prefix set to show time in aidle, after a good number of days, start getting "too many levels of recursion" instead. 
  -  functions leak memory.
  - be sure to build compatability object for MUSE legacy command table.
----------
use fork() to fork off host lookups? ident lookups?  Don't let player connect until they return, but let the rest of the game continue without lag.
add hash table of hosts that have been looked up before.  look there before calling gethostbyname and whatnot.  Will make lookups much faster.
add hash table of locked out guest sites and locked out sites, dynamically changable by admins inside the game. check_lockout()
fix bug with @booting yourself
Pueblo support.  In progress, what a pain. Stripping stuff out of every other musers' text is annoying.
Save the who-list MOTD in a file.
Add support for multiple aliases. might be a bit tricky.
check all references of type int to ensure they shouldn't be type long or dbref
+sitelock
+denied
Add some MAZE features once I get time to look at MAZE src.
Add readable/writeable flags to attributes like UNIX and MOO do it.
Add support for multiple doing_msgs, multiple-lined doing_msgs, and a MAX_DOING_LEN #define for maximum length of doing_msgs. -- this is VERY difficult w/ current who list method.
finish adding MAZE combat + tm97 mods for skills
gnu autoconfigure and make.
Remove WHEN flag completely.  (next release)
Look at MAZE v2's who list for example of dynamically spaced who fields.
Is there an issue with YESEQ and YESLT being equal to YES when they shouldn't be?  See: pow_modify
Fix time in MUSE - actually use the damned TZ variables?  Need to just rewrite all time-related functions.
Com system expansion - Ajoin and a format command like VChicago?
Set limit on how many times you can set yourself idle in a certain period.
Weird time latency problem -- idle after (idletime + 1) and db stops dumping.
Bug with @blacklist - odd problems with checking the lock. sometimes the first person on the list doesn't get blacklisted?



Move most config.h parameters to config.c and make #ifdefs switches.



Idle system is still a little weird:  (this may already be fixed. need to try to recreate)

[00:19:24] Sorry, this is disabled. Try @selfboot.
[00:19:29] [public] Bobby Newmark: shit.
[00:19:37] [public] Bobby Newmark [to Andy]: @cboot 112 please.
[00:19:58] [public] Bobby Newmark: I can't @cboot myself.

[00:20:37] [public] Bobby Newmark: weird.
[00:20:37] [public] Andy: @fo *pp=@cboot 112?
[00:20:56] [public] Bobby Newmark: looks like the idling stuff is still a little whacked.
[00:21:09] [public] Bobby Newmark needs to fix that. weird.


this stuff prolly won't happen anytime soon:

universe power expansion project.
more +mail -- +mail auto deleteion, +mail protect, +mail user@host (external email receive and send)
