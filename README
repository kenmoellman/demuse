dmMUSE README file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

dmMUSE was created by Bobby Newmark (wm) as a branch project.  After leaving 
the tm97 development team, the goal was to create a MUSE server which would 
be more stable, secure and configurable, and less platform specific.   

You can find the latest patches, sourcecode, etc, on the MU*Net website,
http://www.mu-net.org/ via ftp (you can go directly to ftp.mu-net.org also).

deMUSE was created in conjunction with specs given by shkoo for releasing 
TinyMUSE variants.  These rules state that no one can release an offical
version of TinyMUSE without explicit consent.  This version of MUSE was never
intended to be a TinyMUSE release.  The code mods were made to support 
DeMUSEcracy, an online government and social project.  We hope that you will
find the server useful.

deMUSE was developed under Slackware Linux 4.0. It should work at least under 
other versions of Linux, and was tested for a short time with GLIBC2.

You can contact me in the following ways (as of 01/01/2000)
Bobby Newmark:  dm2k@mu-net.net
Please send all bug reports, fixes, etc, to this address.

This software come with no guarentee, and any wording that suggests such 
should be taken as bragging and not as official policy.

This code line has some very bad problems, because the base, the core of this
code is ancient, and has been coded through time by multiple authors and has
problems in efficiency, and possibly stability.  I've done my best to clean
out the junk in the core, and to make the game more efficient, while also
trying to make the game more stable.

MUSE '97 README  -- PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TinyMUSE '97 was not written by shkoo.  Do not bother shkoo with questions
about TinyMUSE '97.

TinyMUSE '97 was written with explicit consent and approval of shkoo.

There are variants and versions of MUSE that have been developed past 
TinyMUSE 1.8a4.  These versions and variants are NOT supported in any way
by shkoo or the authors of TinyMUSE '97.

The variants cannot be upgraded to TinyMUSE '97 as of yet.  TinyMUSE 1.8a4
and lower can be easily upgraded.  We hope to write a db conversion tool for
the base "version" of MUSE 1.9.  This, by the way, was not an official 
TinyMUSE release.

There are still many features being developed, and any features that may be
excluded that you would like to see in the next version of the code, please 
write to use and tell us.  If you've written a peice of code that's useful,
we'd like to see it.  

You can contact us in the following ways (as of 12/31/97)
Bobby Newmark:  newmark@iglou.com
draco: draco@musenet.org
NetRunner: kotcher@cis.ohio-state.edu

Please send all bug reports, bug fixes, and requests to these addresses.
In addition, a mailing was was established for this purpose. It is currently
down after the machine was hacked.  We should have the online soon, and provided
you are a MUSE community person, you shall see us around, and newer versions
will contain more information.

  TinyMUSE (Tiny - Multi User Simulation Environment)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program was born from TinyMUSH, which was made from
TinyMUD by Larry Foard(larry@belch.berkeley.edu). This program
will run any database from old TinyMUD, TinyMUSH v1.5 or older,
but will upgrade it to the new format.

For information on installing this, look in doc/INSTALL. Other
files in the doc directory may be helpful.

TinyMUSE is available via anonymous ftp to mcmuse.mc.maricopa.edu
in the directory pub/muse/server.

You may want to subscribe to the tinymuse mailing list. Send mail
to "tinymuse-request@mcmuse.mc.maricopa.edu" with the word
"subscribe" in the body of the message.  It is strongly encouraged
that you subscribe to this mailing list; bugfixes are posted.
