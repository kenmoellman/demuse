deMUSE was created by Ken Moellman as a branch project of MUSE '97 (aka TinyMUSE 1.97) with the goal to create a MUSE server which would be more stable, secure and configurable, and less platform specific.   

You can find the latest patches, sourcecode, etc, at https://github.com/kenmoellman/demuse

deMUSE is now developed on Ubuntu Linux, after previously being developed under Slackware Linux. It should compile in other versions of Linux.

This software come with no guarentee, and any wording that suggests such should be taken as bragging and not as official policy.

Most recently, the code has undergone significant overhaul.
